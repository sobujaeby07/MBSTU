# File handling operations in Python

# 1. Write to a file
def write_to_file(file_name, text):
    with open(file_name, 'w') as file:
        file.write(text)
    print(f"Text written to {file_name}")

# 2. Read from a file
def read_from_file(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
    print(f"Content of {file_name}:\n{content}")
    return content

# 3. Delete a file
import os
def delete_file(file_name):
    if os.path.exists(file_name):
        os.remove(file_name)
        print(f"{file_name} has been deleted")
    else:
        print(f"{file_name} does not exist")

# 4. Update a file (Append text)
def update_file(file_name, text):
    with open(file_name, 'a') as file:
        file.write(text)
    print(f"Text appended to {file_name}")

# 5. Search for a word in a file
def search_in_file(file_name, search_term):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
        if search_term in content:
            print(f"'{search_term}' found in {file_name}")
        else:
            print(f"'{search_term}' not found in {file_name}")

# Example Usage:
file_name = 'example_file.txt'

write_to_file(file_name, "Hello, this is a test file.\nThis is a second line.")
read_from_file(file_name)
update_file(file_name, "\nThis is the third line.")
read_from_file(file_name)
search_in_file(file_name, "second")
delete_file(file_name)
